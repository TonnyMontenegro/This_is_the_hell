One day I woke up hating myself and decided to learn some shitty esoteric programming language, so I made that abomination in Malbolge.


## pls if you apreciate you life, you time and you mental health, dont try this


### Compiler in C ([``compiler.c``](compiler.c))
this is in C so you can see how it works inside, and you can change someting to compile (you can use clang or another C compiler)

in my case i gonna use clang to compile the ``compiler.c``

```zsh
clang compiler.c -o execute.out
ls -lh                         
```

### Execute the compiler of malbolge ([``execute.out``](execute.out))
after you decide if the default compile is fine, you can use it to compile the ``.mb`` or ``.mal`` file to make the third impact :D (im joking)

in this case my file is named as ``hollyshit.mal`` so i gonna execute


``chmod +x`` is for grant permissions to execute in linux

```zsh
chmod +x execute.out
./execute.out hollyshit.mal
```
